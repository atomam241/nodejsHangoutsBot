# nodejsHangoutsBot
A Node Js powered bot for hangouts, replies with cleverbot responses.

Im a high school student, and this is my first (real) use of GitHub. Also you should know this project was inspired by [KraxBot](https://github.com/KraXarN/KraxBot), thanks to the developers of [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org), and the modules [hangupsjs](https://github.com/algesten/hangupsjs), [ECTOR](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ector), [urban](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urban), and [webshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webshot).

### Disclaimer
- I am not responsible for what the bot says (it can get sassy).
- The bot may crash sometimes (If you can tell me why I will try to fix it).
- The /define function uses Urban Dictionary **it can be NSFW** (sort of 1 again).
- This is not endorsed or affiliated by Google

### Setup

This is pretty easy, you just enter you name in the var owner on line 1. When you run it first you have to "fire up [your] browser and get the requested token" ([hangupsjs](https://github.com/algesten/hangupsjs)). <- Actually see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlDhp-eNLMU).

You should also make sure you have the NodeJs modules:

- [hangupsjs](https://github.com/algesten/hangupsjs)
- [ECTOR](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ector)
- [urban](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urban)
- [webshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webshot)

You launch the bot.js like any other nodejs script
 
### Commands

The commands are: 
- '/lenny' - Makes a lenny face. ie:((͡◔ ͜ʖ ͡◔))
- '/owner' - Says who the owner is. (To brag)
- '/egg' - Annoys all with an easteregg.
- '/title <new title>' - Changes the title of the chat.
- '/leave' - Leaves the chat. (only works in group chats)
- '/define <word>' - defines from Urban Dictionary. (Much Fun)
- '//' - Causes the bot not to send the following text to Cleverbot. (It won't respond)
- '/off' - Turns off the Cleverbot part of the script.
- '/on' - Turns on the Cleverbot part of the script.
